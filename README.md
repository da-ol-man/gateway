Gateway Technical Pty Ltd. site build
This was the original site built for the client to establish a web presence. 
After a few months the client wanted a ecommerce store, but was on a tight budget.
A Wordpress site was built witht the Woocommerce plugin and other free add ons. 
Esssentially the client only paid for time spent and no additional services for the shop. 
The web address points to the wordpress site which will be added to git hub.
